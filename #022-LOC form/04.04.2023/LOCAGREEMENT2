[Whenever the user attempts to change fields by ether using the mouse or
 the tab key a number of pieces of data are sent to this procedure:
 RESPSF = Indicates the field ID that was attempted to be moved to.
 RESPID = Indicates the field ID the user was on.
 RESPVA = Indicates the value that was entered into the field.
 RESPSP = Indicates the page that was attempted to be moved to.
 RESPRD = Indicates the method used to move between field IDs.
 From the statement below you can see that normally SymForm just allows
 the action by changing focus to the requested field.

 This is where field validation could occur. For example if you didn't
 want the user to be able to leave field 10 until a value between
 6 and 18 was entered you could simply add
 IF VALUE(RESPID)=10 AND (VALUE(RESPVA)<6 OR VALUE(RESPVA)>18) THEN
   RESPSF="10"

 Some procedures to help validate common fields will be placed in
 RD.SYMFORM.PRO. The current ones are:

 FIXPHONENUMBER - This procedure will right justify a phone number and
                  ensure that it is 7 or 10 characters long.
                  Ex:  IF VALUE(RESPID)=5 THEN
                         CALL FIXPHONENUMBER
