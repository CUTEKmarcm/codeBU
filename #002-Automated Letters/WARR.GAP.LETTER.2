 Client name:  Austin Telco
 File name:    WARR.GAP.LETTER.2
 Created by:   CUTEK, Inc. - Marc Middleton
 Created on:   NOVEMBER 2022
 CUTEK Ticket: 32282
 
 Description:
 We have 3 letters we’d like produced based on 2 fields in Loan Tracking 30, GAP and Warr (Warranty) for Loan Types 81-84. 
 Our lending department would like these letters auto printed, similar to how GH.BUSINESSLOANS.LETTERHEAD works. 
 We will probably need a way to exclude the account if a letter has already been generated 
  but I am confirming with our Lending department if that is something they want.
 Got confirmation they want this to be a one time letter per loan ID. 
 
 Letter 2 = No Warranty
